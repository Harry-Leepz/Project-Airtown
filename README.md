# Air Town

## Introduction

Welcome to my third project, part of the Code Institute Full Stack Development Course.

Air Town is a project-based around the love of Sneakers and to give Users space where they can post about Sneakers they currently own or are interested in buying.

Growing up one of the sports that captivated me was basketball, and I grew up falling in love with the Sneaker culture. The sneaker trend at one point was the symbol of hip-hop and its separation from the mainstream.

Having started learning programming with no experience in August last year, I have tried to make each of my projects represent something I feel passionate about and love.

Air Town is a full-stack site that will allow users to manage a common dataset. Users will be able to sign up and login and take advantage of the features of the site.

Thank you for visiting Air Town.
